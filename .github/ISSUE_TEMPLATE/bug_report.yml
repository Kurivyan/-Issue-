            description: I have two problems. I play multiplayer version of game mod is installed on dedicated server and on the clients sides. The First problem is that I can't add or creat ftb party to make ftbquests synchronized among me and my friends. Further more two of my friends have a problem with the Leveling, his level progress stoped on 10-th level. Today we killed Lich King, he obtained the screen "Level up to 17-th level" but in the inventory menue and in the tree of skills he still have 10-th lvl and no skill points been added. his player id is 2ea998b8-f3eb-3751-aadf-a6e3076ace6e. I attached world folder and also logs of server, maybe that can help. Waiting for your answer.
